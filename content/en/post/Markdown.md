This document is intended to familiarize the user with the functionality of the Markdown markup language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is a tool for converting code to HTML. The main feature of this language is the simplest syntax, which serves to simplify writing and reading markup code, which, in turn, makes it easy to correct it. Now let's take a closer look at the functions of the Markdown markup language.

Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. The Markdown syntax is quite limited, and corresponds to only a small subset of HTML elements. It includes the following elements:

1.Block elements
- Paragraphs and line breaks;
- Headlines;
- Quotes;
- Lists
- Code blocks;
- Horizontal (dividing) lines.

2.Lowercase elements
- Links;
- Text selection;
- Code fragments of strings;
- Images.

3.Additional elements
- [- [Backslash](#Backslash Escapes);
- [Automatic Links](#Automatic Links);
- HTML special characters.
